# CodingTemple_TodoList

This is a simple todo list that uses two arrays to collect a todo list and the completed tasks.
The todo list accepts new tasks and does not allow repeat tasks in the completed or the original list.
Tasks can be deleted from the todo list, added or moved to the completed list
Incomplete tasks and completed tasks can be viewed seperately
My program is structured this way because it is suppoesed to represent a daily task manager.
The reason for the complete list is to keep the tasks to veiw recent tasks completed the day before.
Finally incomplete tasks would carry to the next day.
This is an incomplete concept but fulfills a daily todo list.
